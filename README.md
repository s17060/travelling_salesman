# travelling_salesman

The app demonstrates two algorithms used to solve the travelling salesman problem: greedy and hill climbing.
Both algorithms are visualised in corresponding windows, where 400 "cities" are situated on a two-dimensional grid. The algorithms optimalise routes between the "cities".
